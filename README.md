# RondDataman
Creates graphs out of Rond database backups, bypassing the requirement for premium.
For educational purposes only.
May require changes as the app is updated and the database format changes.
Requires `sqlite3 matplotlib pillow numpy`.
Edit sf_images with icons in the icons directory to get icons in the graph.
To find icons, try https://heroicons.com/solid and https://remixicon.com/
